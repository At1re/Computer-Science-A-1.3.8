This repository contains a simple Java console application named MorningCoffeeAdventure. The application allows users to customize their coffee order by choosing the size, and whether they want milk and sugar. The program then provides a summary of the user's choices.

Features:
Prompts the user to choose a coffee size (small, medium, or large).
Asks the user if they want to add milk to their coffee.
Asks the user if they want to add sugar to their coffee.
Displays an order summary based on the user's choices.
Usage:
Run the program and follow the prompts to customize your coffee order. The application will handle invalid inputs by providing default choices or assuming no additions.



It follows all the rules and requirements given to me by the teacher of the lesson.
